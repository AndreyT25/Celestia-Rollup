To get started, create a new Foundry project:

      forge init GuessTheNumber
      cd GuessTheNumber
      
Running the test
We can now run our tests to make sure our contract is working properly:

      forge test -vv
      
Deploying to the Ethermint Sovereign Rollup

First, we will need to export the private key generated by the ethermint init.sh script:

      PRIVATE_KEY=$(ethermintd keys unsafe-export-eth-key mykey --keyring-backend test)
      
Now, we can start deploying the smart contract to our Ethermint chain.

To do so, run the following script in the celestia-dapp directory:

      forge script script/GuessTheNumber.s.sol:GuessTheNumberScript --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
      
 If everything was successful, you will receive the address of the contract and the ABI that can be found (your location /out/GuessTheNumber.sol) which we will need later, save them..
